# PasswordFinder
C++ Password Holder Project

Simple C++ project, where you can store your passwords, it uses a textfile that works as a local type of database to find these password

In order to run: Download the project, then simple run the commands `make` and `./run` I made a simple makefile that always for consistent running
A slight problem is that I have system commands such as `system(clear)` which for MACOS but must be renamed for other OS
